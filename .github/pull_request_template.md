## Summary

-

## Quality checklist

- [ ] `bun run verify` passes locally
- [ ] If any `eslint-disable` or `@ts-expect-error` was added, each one includes a reason
- [ ] No new `any` was introduced without an inline justification
- [ ] No lint rule relaxations were added for tests (no test-only ESLint overrides/downgrades)
- [ ] Existing required workflows are green (`quality`, `arena-e2e`, `starter-contract` when applicable)
